	<p align="center" id="para">welcome to my webpage. On this webpage the dispersion of religions around the globe and occurence of religions within countries is visualised. also the countries will be represented in a scatterplot mapping the percentge of most wide spread religion in countries and social the social values; literacy rate, happiness index and life expectancy. It is interesting to see how relgions are dispersed around the world since most of these religions have been with mankind for many of thousend years. The greatest wars in history were fought for beliefs and millions of citizens spend theire entire life living as religions dictate. Some of the religions can be seen to stay mostly at the parts of the world were they started as for hinduism and buddhism in the south and south-east of asia. but it can also be seen that religions as the islam and chrisianity have spread over wide parts of the world by many crusades, wars and imperialism. In the datamap on the data page the most common religions per country can be seen but it is also possible to toggle between religion to get a good look at how a particular religion is spread. Clicking on a country will toggle a pie chart of the percentages believers of religions within that country</p>
